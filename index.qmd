# Introduction

This website hosts the materials and exercises for the DataSHIELD workshop for the CORDELIA project. On it you will find reading materials, setup tutorials, workshop indications and practical exercises.

The workshop is organized by [Bioinformatics Research Group in Epidemiology (BRGE)](https://brge.isglobal.org) from the [Barcelona Institute for Global Health (iSGlobal)](https://isglobal.org).

# Getting Started

All practical exercises will be conducted using the [public Opal demo server](https://opal-demo.obiba.org/). This server provides a fully functional DataSHIELD environment with sample datasets that workshop participants can use to replicate the examples.

Login credentials for the demo server are:

- Username: `dsuser`
- Password: `P@ssw0rd`

Before starting, make sure to install the required R packages in your local machine:

```r
install.packages('DSI')
install.packages('DSOpal')

install.packages('dsBaseClient', repos=c(getOption('repos'), 'http://cran.datashield.org'), dependencies=TRUE)

install.packages("metafor")
devtools::install_github("timcadman/ds-helper")
```
